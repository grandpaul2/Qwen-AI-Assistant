# WorkspaceAI v3.0

A lightweight AI toolkit with **85-90% tool detection accuracy** that enhances language models with file management capabilities and persistent memory. Designed for qwen2.5:3b but compatible with most Ollama models. Works on Windows and Linux.

## ðŸ†• Version 3.0 Major Enhancements

### Advanced Tool Detection System
- **85-90% Accuracy**: Upgraded from 50% baseline with research-backed improvements
- **Contextual Pattern Matching**: Understands conversational requests like "save that as .md file"
- **Auto-Unique Filenames**: Prevents conflicts with automatic naming (file.txt â†’ file_1.txt)
- **Enhanced System Prompt**: CRITICAL RULE enforcement for reliable tool usage
- **Runtime Guidance**: Smart assistance for ambiguous cases

## Core Features

### Secure Workspace Sandbox System

## Quick Start

### Windows Setup

#### 1. Setup Ollama and Load Model
```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai/download
ollama serve
ollama run qwen2.5:3b
# Type /bye to exit chat but keep model loaded in VRAM for faster responses
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or manually install:
```bash
pip install requests tqdm
```

#### 3. Start WorkspaceAI
```bash
python workspaceai.py
```

### Linux Setup

#### 1. Quick Install (Recommended)
```bash
chmod +x install_linux.sh
./install_linux.sh
```

#### 2. Manual Setup
```bash
# Install Python and pip (if not already installed)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip  # Ubuntu/Debian
# OR
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip  # Fedora
# OR  
sudo pacman -S python python-pip      # Arch Linux

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user

# Install Ollama and Load Model
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama serve
ollama run qwen2.5:3b
# Type /bye to exit chat but keep model loaded in VRAM for faster responses
```

#### 3. Start WorkspaceAI
```bash
python3 workspaceai.py

```

### Software Installation
```
You: install: Python
You: install: VS Code

```

### Memory Management
```
/memory     # Show memory statistics
/tools      # List available file tools
/new        # Start fresh conversation (saves current)
/reset      # Clear all memory
```

### Mode Control
```
chat: What's the weather like?           # Force normal chat
tools: create file hello.txt            # Force file tools
install: Discord                         # Get installation commands
```

## Configuration

The assistant auto-creates `WorkspaceAI/config.json` with these settings:

```json
{
  "version": "3.0",
  "settings": {
    "model": "qwen2.5:3b",
    "safe_mode": true,
    "ollama_host": "localhost:11434",
    "search_max_file_kb": 1024
  }
}
```

**To change settings:** Use `/config` command during chat

### Configuration Constants
The application uses centralized constants for better maintainability:
- `API_TIMEOUT`: 30 seconds
- `API_MAX_RETRIES`: 3 attempts  
- `MAX_RECENT_CONVERSATIONS`: 2
- `MAX_SUMMARIZED_CONVERSATIONS`: 8
- `MAX_FILENAME_LENGTH`: 255 characters

## Key Benefits

1. **Single File Architecture**: Everything you need in one `workspaceai.py` file
2. **Auto-Configuration**: Creates folders and config automatically - no setup required
3. **Portable Design**: Put anywhere, works everywhere - no hardcoded paths
4. **Direct Interface**: Starts immediately in classic chat mode - no menu delays
5. **Persistent AI Memory**: Unlike standard chat sessions, maintains context across restarts
6. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combines AI reasoning with programmatic file operations
7. **Safety First**: Built-in protections prevent accidental data loss
8. **Enhanced Reliability**: Network retry logic, comprehensive error handling
9. **Security Features**: Path traversal protection, input validation, workspace-only operations
10. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring
11. **Self-Contained**: No external services required beyond Ollama

## Notes

- Models stay loaded in VRAM until manually unloaded or system restart
- First model load takes ~5-10 seconds, subsequent calls are instant
- Safe mode prevents file deletions and overwrites by default
- Auto-detection works well, but you can force modes with `chat:`, `tools:`, or `install:` prefixes
- All file operations are contained within the workspace directory for security
- Progress indicators show for long operations like file searches and backups
- Use `/tools` to see all available file management functions
- Comprehensive logging helps with debugging (check WorkspaceAI/workspaceai.log)
- Network operations include automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Input validation prevents path traversal and filename security issues
