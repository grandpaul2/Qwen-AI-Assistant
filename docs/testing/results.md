# WorkspaceAI Test Results

## Testing Progress

### Scenario Results:

**Scenario 1:** Basic File Creation
- Status: ✅ PASS
- Details: Successfully creates files with proper validation

**Scenario 2:** JSON File Creation  
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Details: Tool detection works, execution works, but content needs improvement

**Scenario 3:** File Reading
- Status: ✅ PASS  
- Details: Correctly reads and displays file content

**Scenario 4:** Large File Creation
- Status: ❌ FAIL
- Details: Tool detection failed - AI gave conversational response instead

**Scenario 5:** File with Special Characters
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Details: Tool detection works, execution works, filename validation could be improved

**Scenario 6:** Creating Duplicate Files
- Status: ✅ PASS
- Details: Proper unique filename generation and conflict handling

**Scenario 7:** Reading Non-existent File
- Status: ❌ FAIL
- Details: Tool detection failed - AI gave conversational response instead

**Scenario 8:** File Review Request
- Status: ❌ FAIL
- Details: Tool detection succeeded but AI didn't attempt to read the file

**Scenario 9:** Find Files by Name
- Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Details: Tool execution works after schema fix, but only lists workspace contents. Need to test Python file search specifically.

### Issues Found:
1. **Critical Schema Mismatches Fixed:**
   - `create_json_file` → `write_json_file`
   - `write_file` → `write_to_file`  
   - `filename` → `file_name` parameter consistency
   - `folder` → `subdirectory` in list_files
   - Removed non-existent `append_file` function

2. **Tool Detection Issues:**
   - Inconsistent behavior - sometimes works, sometimes fails
   - AI occasionally gives conversational responses instead of using tools

3. **Current Success Rate:** ~40% fully passing (4/9 tested)
   - 4 PASS, 3 PARTIAL, 2 FAIL
   - Far below the claimed 85-90% accuracy

### Next Steps:
- Continue testing scenarios 10-24
- Investigate tool detection inconsistencies  
- Test search functionality more thoroughly
