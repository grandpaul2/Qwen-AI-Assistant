- Dependency management

### 5. Context-Aware Scenarios

#### Scenario 5.1: File Reference Without Names
**Test Sequence**:
1. `"Create a Python script called data_processor.py"`

3. `"Create a test file for it"`
4. `"Show me both files"`

**Expected Enhancements**:
- Implicit file reference resolution
- Context-based parameter completion
- Relationship tracking
- Smart file association

#### Scenario 5.2: Conversational Continuity
**Test Sequence**:

```
"Everything is broken and I don't know what to do. My project is a mess and nothing works. Help!"
```
**Expected Enhancements**:
- Emotional support response
- Systematic problem breakdown
- Calming guidance
- Step-by-step assistance

#### Scenario 6.2: Multiple Conflicting Requests
**Test Input**:
```
"Create a file, no wait delete it, actually I want to edit something else, can you list my files first?"
```
**Expected Enhancements**:
- Request prioritization
- Clarification seeking
- Conflict resolution
- User intent clarification

### 7. Learning and Adaptation Scenarios

#### Scenario 7.1: Pattern Recognition

- `"Create a Python module for data processing"`
- `"Create another Python module for file handling"`
- `"Create one more Python module for configuration"`

**Expected Enhancements**:
- Pattern learning
- Template reuse
- Efficiency improvements
- User preference adaptation

#### Scenario 7.2: Feedback Integration

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### How to Test:
1. **Start Fresh**: Begin each test category with a new session
2. **Natural Language**: Use conversational, natural language
3. **Be Realistic**: Test like a real user would interact
4. **Document Results**: Note which enhancements work/don't work
5. **Progress Through Scenarios**: Test in sequence to build context

### What to Look For:

#### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Behaviors:**
- **Context Awareness**: References to previous operations
- **Smart Suggestions**: Proactive helpful recommendations
- **Adaptive Tone**: Response style matching user communication
- **Error Recovery**: Helpful troubleshooting when things go wrong
- **Learning**: System remembering preferences and patterns
- **Efficiency**: Fewer steps needed for complex operations

#### ‚ùå **Missing Enhancements:**
- Generic responses without context
- No reference to previous work
- Robotic, non-conversational tone
- No proactive assistance
- Repeated mistakes
- Inefficient multi-step processes
