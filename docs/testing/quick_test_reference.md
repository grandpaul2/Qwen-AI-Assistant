- References to previous operations ("that file", "the script we created")
- Proactive suggestions and help
- Context-aware tool selection
- Empathetic tone when user is frustrated

❌ **Enhancement Needed:**
- Robotic, generic responses
- No memory of previous operations
- Same response style regardless of user tone
- No helpful suggestions
- Ignoring context clues
