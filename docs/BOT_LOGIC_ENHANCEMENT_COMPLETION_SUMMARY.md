  - Provides context-aware memory for enhanced decision making

- **Enhanced Intent Classifier** (`src/enhanced_intent_classifier.py`)
  - Context-aware intent classification with conversation memory
  - Multi-step operation detection
  - Improved accuracy through contextual analysis

- **Smart Tool Selector** (`src/smart_tool_selector.py`)
  - Context-driven tool selection with user pattern recognition
  - Multi-step operation planning capabilities
  - Intelligent parameter prediction

### Phase 2: Response Intelligence âœ…
- **Response Intelligence** (`src/response_intelligence.py`)
  - Contextual response generation based on operation outcomes
  - Adaptive messaging based on user skill level and context
  - Multi-step operation response coordination

### Phase 3: Advanced User Experience âœ…
- **Advanced User Experience** (`src/advanced_user_experience.py`)
  - Conversational Interface for natural interaction
