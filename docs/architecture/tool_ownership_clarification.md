# Tool Implementation Clarity

## What Ollama Provides vs What We Provide

### Ollama/qwen2.5:3b Provides:
- Natural language understanding
- Tool selection intelligence  
- Parameter generation
- Reasoning about which tools to use

### We (WorkspaceAI) Provide:
- All actual tool implementations
- Tool schemas/definitions
- Tool execution logic
- File system access
- Calculator logic
- Code execution environment
- System command execution

## Example Flow:

```
User Request: "t: create a Python script that prints hello world"

Step 1: Our system sends to Ollama
POST /api/chat {
  "messages": [...],
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "file_operations", 
      "description": "File operations",
      "parameters": {...}
    }
  ]
}

Step 2: qwen2.5:3b responds
{
  "message": {
    "tool_calls": [{
      "function": {
        "name": "file_operations",
        "arguments": {
          "action": "create",
          "path": "hello.py", 
          "content": "print('Hello, World!')"
        }
      }
    }]
  }
}

Step 3: Our system executes OUR tool
def file_operations(action, path, content):
    if action == "create":
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f"Created {path}"

Step 4: User gets result
"Created hello.py"
```

## Key Point:
Ollama is like a smart assistant that can read tool manuals (our schemas) and tell us which tools to use and how, but WE own all the actual tools in the toolbox.

## Why This Matters:
- We have complete control over what tools exist
- We implement all security and safety measures  
- We can add any custom functionality we want
- Ollama just provides the intelligence to use our tools effectively

## Analogy:
- **Ollama/qwen2.5:3b** = Smart foreman who reads blueprints and gives instructions
- **Our Tools** = The actual hammers, screwdrivers, and power tools
- **User** = Person who wants something built

The foreman is very smart and can read any blueprint we give them, but they don't own any tools - we provide all the tools and do all the actual work based on their intelligent instructions.
