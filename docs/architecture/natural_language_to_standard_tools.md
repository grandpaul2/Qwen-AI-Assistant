# Example: Natural Language → Standard Tool Format

## Current Flow (Domain-Specific Tools)
```
User: "t: create a file called test.txt"
       ↓
Ollama: "I should call create_file with {file_name: 'test.txt', content: ''}"
       ↓
System: Executes create_file()
       ↓
User: "File created successfully!"
```

## Proposed Flow (Standard Tools)
```
User: "t: create a file called test.txt"
       ↓
Ollama: "I should call file_operations with {action: 'create', path: 'test.txt', content: ''}"
       ↓
System: Executes file_operations(action='create', ...)
       ↓
User: "File created successfully!"
```

## More Complex Examples

### User Says (Natural Language):
- "t: create a Python script that prints hello world"
- "t: read the contents of config.json"
- "t: delete all the temp files"
- "t: copy readme.md to docs folder"

### Ollama Responds (Standard Format):
```json
// Create Python script
{
    "function": "file_operations",
    "arguments": {
        "action": "create",
        "path": "hello.py",
        "content": "print('Hello, World!')"
    }
}

// Read config file
{
    "function": "file_operations", 
    "arguments": {
        "action": "read",
        "path": "config.json"
    }
}

// Delete temp files (could be multiple calls)
{
    "function": "file_operations",
    "arguments": {
        "action": "delete",
        "path": "temp/*.tmp"
    }
}

// Copy file
{
    "function": "file_operations",
    "arguments": {
        "action": "copy", 
        "path": "readme.md",
        "destination": "docs/readme.md"
    }
}
```

## Benefits:

1. **User-Friendly**: Natural language interface
2. **Standard-Compliant**: Uses industry-standard tool names
3. **Ollama-Native**: Leverages Ollama's built-in intelligence for parameter extraction
4. **Flexible**: Can handle complex requests that map to multiple tool calls
5. **Familiar**: Tools have names users recognize from other AI systems

## Implementation:
The user experience stays exactly the same - they just type natural language. The only change is that our tool schemas use standard names like `file_operations` instead of `create_file`, and Ollama handles all the natural language → structured tool call conversion.

This gives us the best of both worlds: 
- **Intuitive user experience** (natural language)
- **Standard tool integration** (industry conventions)
- **Powerful AI understanding** (Ollama does the heavy lifting)

Should I implement the `file_operations` standard tool to replace our current file-specific tools?
