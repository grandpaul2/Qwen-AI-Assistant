### Phase 3: Advanced User Experience (Week 3)
**Goal**: Create a more intuitive and helpful assistant

#### 3.1 Conversational Interface
- Natural language understanding improvements
- Better handling of colloquial language
- Context-sensitive help and suggestions
- User preference learning

#### 3.2 Workflow Intelligence
- Project-aware assistance
- Automated workflow suggestions
- Template and pattern recognition
- Collaborative workflow support

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New Components to Add

#### 1. Context Manager (`src/context_manager.py`)
```python
class ConversationContext:
    """Manages conversation context and session state"""
    - session_memory: Dict[str, Any]
    - operation_history: List[Dict]
    - file_state: Dict[str, FileInfo]
    - user_patterns: Dict[str, Any]
```

#### 2. Enhanced Intent Classifier (`src/enhanced_intent_classifier.py`)
```python
class EnhancedIntentClassifier(IntentClassifier):
    """Context-aware intent classification with conversation memory"""
    - classify_with_context(user_input, context)
    - detect_multi_step_operations(user_input, context)
    - resolve_ambiguous_intent(user_input, context, previous_intents)
```

#### 3. Smart Tool Selector (`src/smart_tool_selector.py`)
```python
class SmartToolSelector(ContextWeightedToolSelector):
    """Context-aware tool selection with planning capabilities"""
    - select_tools_with_context(intent, user_input, context)
    - plan_multi_step_operations(intent, user_input, context)
    - suggest_alternative_tools(intent, user_input, context)
```

#### 4. Response Intelligence (`src/response_intelligence.py`)
```python
class ResponseIntelligence:
    """Generates intelligent, context-aware responses"""
    - generate_contextual_response(operation, result, context)
    - explain_operation_steps(operation_plan)
    - suggest_next_actions(context, result)
```

### Enhancement Priorities

#### Priority 1: Context-Aware Intent Classification
- Add conversation memory to intent scoring
- Detect when users reference previous work ("the file we created earlier")
- Better handling of pronouns and context references
- Multi-step operation detection

#### Priority 2: Smart Tool Selection with Planning
- Tool selection considering conversation context
- Multi-tool operation planning for complex requests
- Context-aware confidence scoring
- Fallback strategies with explanations

#### Priority 3: Conversational Response System
- Generate helpful, context-aware responses
- Explain what's happening and why
- Provide proactive suggestions
- Better error explanation and recovery

## ðŸ“Š Testing Strategy

### Using Our Enhanced Testing Framework
- **Property-Based Testing**: Test new logic with varied inputs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure enhancements don't slow down operations
- **Contract Testing**: Validate new interfaces maintain consistency
- **Integration Testing**: Test context flow between components

### New Test Categories
- **Context Awareness Tests**: Validate conversation memory and context usage
- **Multi-Step Operation Tests**: Test complex operation planning and execution
- **Response Intelligence Tests**: Validate response quality and helpfulness
- **User Experience Tests**: Test conversational flow and user satisfaction

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Response Relevance**: % of responses that directly address user intent
- **Context Accuracy**: % of context references correctly understood
- **Operation Success**: % of multi-step operations completed successfully
- **Performance**: Maintain sub-millisecond core operation times

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Conversational Quality**: More natural and helpful interactions
- **Error Recovery**: Better handling of unclear or incorrect requests
- **User Guidance**: Proactive suggestions and explanations
- **Learning**: System improves with user interaction patterns
