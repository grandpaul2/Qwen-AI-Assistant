- No cross-contamination of conversation contexts
- Model-aware memory operations functioning correctly

### 3. Adaptive Context Management
- Budget allocation working within design targets
- Complexity analysis differentiating simple vs complex queries
- Dynamic resource allocation based on query characteristics

### 4. Tool Integration
